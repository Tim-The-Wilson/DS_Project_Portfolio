# Data Science Project Portfolio
I will keep a copy of my Jupyter notebooks, Python code, R code, and other assorted files associated with my projects here. For easier to read posts: [https://timthewilson.com](https://timthewilson.com)

Currently I have my stock price direction prediction project and my customer churn prediction project posted. But more will follow very soon.

Projects to expect in the near future:

- IMDB Review Sentiment Analysis
- Stock Price prediction model via RNN with LSTM layers
- Customer Propensity to Purchase predictions
